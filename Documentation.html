    <h1>Documentation :D1</h1>

        On the first day, we learned what HTML is, where it is used, and where we write HTML code. <br> We used VS Code as our coding environment. We also explored boilerplate code and its <br>purpose. Additionally, we learned about HTML attributes and different tags such as: <br>
        <br>
        
        (br)tag for line breaks <br> <br>
        Heading tags ((h1) to (h6)) for different heading sizes <br>
        <br>

        (p) tag for paragraphs <br> <br>
        And other basic HTML elements
     <br>
        <h1>Day 2:</h1> <br>
        <hr>
       <p> On the second day, we explored HTML attributes in more detail. We learned about different structural tags such as: <br> <br>
        (header) â€“ Represents the top section of a webpage <br> <br>
       (main) â€“ Contains the main content <br> <br>

        (footer) â€“ Represents the bottom section of a webpage <br> <br>
        Inside the (main) tag, we explored three more elements: <br> <br>
        (article) â€“ Represents an independent piece of content <br> <br>
        (aside) â€“ Used for side content like ads or related links <br> <br>
        We also learned about the <table> tag and how to create tables in HTML. <br> <br>
        
         <h1>Day 3:</h1>
         <hr>
         <p>
            On the third day, we focused on HTML forms. We explored the (form) tag and its <br> attributes, learning how to create input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns, <br> and submit buttons. <br>
            <br>
            This summarizes all the topics we covered in these three days. ðŸš€
